### WIP

## Using Gatsby to create an easy way for me to turn friends markdown into an updated comicstrip CMS blog.

using graphql as a means of exposure to graphql and Gatsby. However at the moment I may just keep it updated by hosting on github and commiting markdown files. Later if I decide I should implement a database then I will use the graphql already implemented for that. Kind of a backwards, I intended to use a DB however, simple now to keep it very simple.
